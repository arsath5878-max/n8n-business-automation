📊 Business WhatsApp AI Lead Automation (n8n)

A business-oriented WhatsApp automation workflow built using n8n, Google Gemini, and Google Sheets to automate customer engagement, lead qualification, and data management. This system enables businesses to capture leads automatically, respond to customers instantly, and maintain a structured lead database without manual intervention.

🚀 Overview

This automation creates a 24/7 intelligent WhatsApp assistant that interacts with customers, understands both text and voice messages, extracts important lead information, and securely stores the data in Google Sheets for CRM, sales, and marketing workflows.

The workflow automatically processes incoming messages, transcribes audio inputs into text using Google Gemini, and uses an AI conversational agent to collect customer details such as:

Customer Name

Email Address

Phone Number

Purpose of Inquiry (services, pricing, support, meetings, orders, etc.)

The chatbot asks only for missing information, confirms captured details, and sends an automated response back to the customer, ensuring a professional and smooth communication experience.
